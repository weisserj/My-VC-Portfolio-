# My VC "Portfolio"
I’m investing $100k of imaginary money into my favorite companies and tracking their progress over time. Fun!

## My Investments

Every month, I’ll invest $100k of fake capital into a handful of companies. I’ll put the date of “investment” and revisit each investment at a later date to see how they did. I'm sure they'll all wow you! :-)

#### [Omni](https://www.beomni.com/)
Progress since investment: I participated in the $7M series A (typically a no-no as an angel but I made an exception here) led by Highland and 8 months later Omni raised $25M from Ripple executives which they believe will enable them to forgo a few rounds of financing down the road (preventing further dilution in my fake investment).
