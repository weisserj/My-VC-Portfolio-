# My VC "Portfolio"
I’m investing $100k of funny money into my favorite companies and tracking their progress over time. Fun!

## My Investments

Every month, I’ll invest $100k of fake capital into a handful of companies. I’ll put the date of “investment” and revisit each investment at a later date to see how they did. I'm sure they'll all wow you! :-)
