# My VC "Portfolio"
I’m investing $100k of funny money into my favorite companies and tracking their progress over time. Fun!

## My Investments

Every month, I’ll invest $100k of fake capital into a handful of companies. I’ll put the date of “investment” and revisit each investment at a later date to see how they did. I'm sure they'll all wow you! :-)

#### [Lambda School](https://lambdaschool.com/)

You may ask yourself, "what makes Lambda different than other coding schools that cannot easily be replicated by all of the others?"

The answer is the founders. The level of creativity and drive is next-level. Betting against them would be a mistake so  I'm in.

#### [Customer Science](https://customersci.com)

Perks of being around Tyler and Noah as they build this company are that I'm getting in early. Huge believer in these two and know that the market finds what they're building to be of extremely high value. That, plus their track record? A no-brainer if I've ever heard of one.

#### [Omni](https://www.beomni.com/)

I was one of the first hundred users and Omni was already delivering an admirable initial service. Just a glimpse at the potential for this platform has me transfixed. I wish I had thought to start this fund earlier so I could have gotten a better deal on this!

#### [Knack](https://www.joinknack.com/)

I’m a huge believer in the ability for tech to enable better human interactions. Knack is approaching tutoring in a fundamentally different way than anyone else. Samyr is a great CEO and I value his openness.

#### [Movebutter](https://www.movebutter.com/)

I love everything about this new kind of grocery store. They sell one product, the attention to detail is stunning, and the value is immense.

#### [Loom](https://www.useloom.com/)

This is the most impressive in-browser video recording software I’ve seen. The best products work how you’d expect them to — no learning curve — and this is a great example. It doesn’t just work, it works brilliantly. The team is relentless and technical and I have no doubt they will continue to build indispensable tools.
