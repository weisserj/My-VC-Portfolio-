# My VC "Portfolio"
I’m investing $100k of funny money into my favorite companies and tracking their progress over time. Fun!

## My Investments

Every month, I’ll invest $100k of fake capital into a handful of companies. I’ll put the date of “investment” and revisit each investment at a later date to see how they did. I'm sure they'll all wow you! :-)

#### [Omni](https://www.beomni.com/)

I was one of the first hundred users and Omni was already delivering an admirable initial service. Just a glimpse at the potential for this platform has me transfixed. I wish I had thought to start this fund earlier so I could have gotten a better deal on this!

#### [Knack](https://www.joinknack.com/)

I’m a huge believer in the ability for tech to enable better human interactions. Knack is approaching tutoring in a fundamentally different way than anyone else. Samyr is a great CEO and I value his openness.

#### [Movebutter](https://www.movebutter.com/)

I love everything about this new kind of grocery store. They sell one product, the attention to detail is stunning, and the value is immense.

#### [Loom](https://www.useloom.com/)

This is the most impressive in-browser video recording software I’ve seen. The best products work how you’d expect them to — no learning curve — and this is a great example. It doesn’t just work, it works brilliantly. The team is relentless and technical and I have no doubt they will continue to build indispensable tools.
