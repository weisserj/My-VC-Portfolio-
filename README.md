# My VC "Portfolio"
I’m investing $100k of funny money into my favorite companies and tracking their progress over time. Fun!

## My Investments

Every month, I’ll invest $100k of fake capital into a handful of companies. I’ll put the date of “investment” and revisit each investment at a later date to see how they did. I'm sure they'll all wow you! :-)

### August 10, 2018

#### [Holloway](https://www.holloway.com/)


### September 10, 2017

#### [Lambda School](https://lambdaschool.com/)
Progress since investment: Graduated first class of students and 25% had jobs within one week. Raised a $4m seed round. One student was directly hired into a senior engineering role. Raised Series A October 2018 with Google Ventures, Stripe and others. Latest: Raised $30M series B with Bedrock Capital, YC, Ashton Kutcher, Google Ventures, and others.

### September 8, 2017

#### [Customer Science](https://customersci.com)
Progress since investment: Can’t disclose anything but I feel even better now than when I first “invested” in Customer Science :)

### April 8, 2017

#### [Omni](https://www.beomni.com/)
Progress since investment: I participated in the $7M series A (typically a no-no as an angel but I made an exception here) led by Highland and 8 months later Omni raised $25M from Ripple executives which they believe will enable them to forgo a few rounds of financing down the road (preventing further dilution in my fake investment).

#### [Knack](https://www.joinknack.com/)
Progress since investment: closed $1.5M seed round co-led by Charles Hudson’s Precursor Ventures and Tampa Bay Lighting owner and Fenway Sports Group Partner, Jeff Vinik. Other investors in the round include Bisk Ventures, the corporate venture-arm of Bisk Education; Arizona State University Enterprise Partners; Doug Feirstein, founder of Hired, uSell, and LiveOps; former State of Florida CFO Alex Sink; Tom DiBenedetto of Fenway Sports Group; PAR Inc.; and Elysium Venture Capital.

#### [Movebutter](https://www.movebutter.com/)
Now renamed to Move (Direct-to-consumer grocery store).

#### [Loom](https://www.useloom.com/)
Progress since investment: 1.5 months after investing, Loom raised money from SaaS legends Brian Balfour (Hubspot) and Hiten Shah (Kissmetrics) along with other great investors. Latest: closed $11M series A led by Kleiner Perkins with Ilya Fushman (ex-head of product at Dropbox, board member of Slack, Intercom and now Loom).
